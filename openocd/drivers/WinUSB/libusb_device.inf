; The Include directive in the USB_Install.Services section includes the system-
; supplied INF for WinUSB. This INF is installed by the WinUSB co-installer if

; WinUsb.sys as the device’s function driver. These directives should not be 
; modified.

; interface globally unique identifier (GUID) for your device. The AddReg 
; directive puts the interface GUID in a standard registry value. When 
; WinUsb.sys is loaded as the device’s function driver, it reads the registry
; value and uses the specified GUID to represent the device interface. You 
; should replace the GUID in this example with one that you create specifically
; for your device. If the protocols for the device change, you should create a
; new device interface GUID.
